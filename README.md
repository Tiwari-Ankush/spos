statements


1.	Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives. The output of Pass-I (intermediate code file and symbol table) should be input for Pass-II.

2.	Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass macro processor. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT and intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II.

3.	Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS , Priority (Non-Preemptive)

4.	Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: SJF (Preemptive)and Round Robin (Preemptive).

5.	Write a program to simulate Memory placement strategies – best fit, first fit.

6.	Write a program to simulate Memory placement strategies – next fit and worst fit.
